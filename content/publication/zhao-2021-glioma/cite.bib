abstract="The accurate classification of gliomas is essential in clinical practice. It is valuable for clinical practitioners and patients to choose the appropriate management accordingly, promoting the development of personalized medicine. In the MICCAI 2020 Combined Radiology and Pathology Classification Challenge, 4 MRI sequences and a WSI image are provided for each patient. Participants are required to use the multi-modal images to predict the subtypes of glioma. In this paper, we proposed a fully automated pipeline for glioma classification. Our proposed model consists of two parts: feature extraction and feature fusion, which are respectively responsible for extracting representative features of images and making prediction. In specific, we proposed a segmentation-free self-supervised feature extraction network for 3D MRI volume. And a feature extraction model is designed for the H{\&}E stained WSI by associating traditional image processing methods with convolutional neural network. Finally, we fuse the extracted features from multi-modal images and use a densely connected neural network to predict the final classification results. We evaluate the proposed model with F1-Score, Cohen's Kappa, and Balanced Accuracy on the validation set, which achieves 0.943, 0.903, and 0.889 respectively.",
